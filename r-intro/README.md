# Introduction to R and RStudio

For this workshop we'll be be using material from Data Carpentry's Intro to R and RStudio for Genomics <https://datacarpentry.github.io/genomics-r-intro/>

We'll be modifying the content covered so it more closely aligns with the R methods used in the eDNA/Metabarcoding analysis that we'll be doing in the main part of the workshop.

## Introducing R and RStudio IDE

### RStudio Server

**We will not be using RStudio Server**. Instead, start up RStudio on your computer.

### Creating a new project

- On Macs, please create the new project, "dc_genomics_r" in your home folder. In Browse, go to "/Users/USERNAME". This is likely the default option.

- On Windows, click on Browse and navigate to `C:\Users\USERNAME`. The default option in Windows is you Documents folder, even though it shows a `~`.

Why? We've seen issues with saving to folders that have spaces in their names and those that are sync'd to Dropbox or OneDrive.
